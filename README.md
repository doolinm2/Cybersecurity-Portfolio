* Bash scripting
* SQL queries for data analysis and investigation

**Implementation:**

* Built a log parser using Bash to automate **system log analysis**.
* Wrote SQL queries to analyze **user activity logs** and detect anomalies.

---

### 5. **Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**

**Key Skills:**

* Threat modeling and vulnerability scanning
* CVSS scores, OWASP Top 10
* Tools: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS

**Implementation:**

* Performed **local vulnerability scans** using Nmap and OpenVAS.
* Documented findings and created sample **remediation plans** for common issues.

---

### 6. **Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response**

**Key Skills:**

* SIEM systems (Splunk basics)
* Event correlation and triage
* Incident detection and response lifecycle
* Indicators of compromise (IOCs)

**Implementation:**
